## Overview
Zenith is a conceptual operating system designed for spatial computing. It explores how interfaces should behave when they are no longer tethered to a 2D screen.

## Key Design Principles
- **Visual Depth:** Using multi-layer blur and shadow casting to define hierarchy without using solid colors.
- **Gaze-Based Interaction:** UI elements that subtly glow or enlarge when the user's "cursor" (or eyes) pass over them.
- **Adaptive Lighting:** The interface colors shift based on the brightness of the "environment" behind the glass.

## Impact
Zenith won "Best Experimental UI" at the 2025 Global Design Awards.
