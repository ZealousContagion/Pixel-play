## Overview
Neural Interface is a conceptual UI/UX project exploring the future of human-computer interaction. The design focuses on brain-computer interface (BCI) visualization and minimalist control systems.

## The Challenge
How do we visualize thought patterns and neural feedback in a way that is both beautiful and functional for medical or creative professional use?

## Key Features
- **Biometric Visualization:** Real-time rendering of simulated EEG data.
- **Adaptive Layouts:** Interfaces that morph based on the user's focus level.
- **Dark Mode Optimization:** High-contrast, low-strain visuals for long-term monitoring.

## Process
1.  **Research:** Studied existing BCI software and identified visual fatigue as a major issue.
2.  **Iterative Design:** Created over 50 iterations of the core "Neural Node" visualization.
3.  **Prototyping:** Built a functional prototype in React to test the fluid transitions between UI states.

## Impact
This project has been cited in several design publications as a benchmark for futuristic, functional dashboard design.
