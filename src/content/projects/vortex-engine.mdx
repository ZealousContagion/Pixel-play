## Overview
Vortex Engine is a high-performance particle simulation system capable of rendering over a million unique particles in real-time within the browser.

## Technical Objective
To create a fluid dynamics simulation that leverages the full power of GPU computation via custom GLSL compute shaders.

## Key Engineering
- **GPGPU Simulation:** Using Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs) to store particle positions and velocities in textures.
- **Custom Shaders:** A sophisticated vertex shader that handles particle positioning, and a fragment shader for the "energy" glow effects.
- **Optimization:** Utilized Instanced Mesh rendering to keep draw calls at a minimum.

## Challenges Overcome
The primary hurdle was syncing the physics calculation with the rendering loop. By moving all calculations to the GPU, I was able to achieve a 10x increase in particle count compared to CPU-based simulations.

## Final Result
A mesmerizing, interactive 3D vortex that users can manipulate with their mouse or touch, demonstrating the high-performance capabilities of modern WebGL.
