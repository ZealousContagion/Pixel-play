## Overview
Neon Horizon is an immersive city flythrough that showcases the power of custom shaders and instanced geometry in Three.js. It was designed as a "benchmark" piece for high-end creative web experiences.

## Technical Goals
- Render thousands of unique buildings without exceeding 30 draw calls.
- Implement a sophisticated post-processing stack (Bloom, Scanlines, Chromatic Aberration).
- Create a reactive environment that responds to real-time audio data.

## Execution
- **Instancing:** Instead of rendering each building individually, I used `InstancedMesh` to draw all structures of a similar type in a single call, drastically reducing CPU-to-GPU overhead.
- **GLSL Post-Processing:** Wrote a custom "Cyber-Scanline" pass that gives the scene its signature retro-future digital look.
- **Data Flow:** Built a custom audio analyzer that maps frequency bands to building height and emissive light intensity.

## Challenges
Balancing the heavy post-processing effects with mobile performance was the biggest hurdle. I implemented a dynamic resolution scaling system that adjusts based on the user's current frame rate.

## Result
A stable 60FPS experience that has been used as a demo for several 3D-on-the-web presentations. It remains one of my most technically challenging and visually rewarding projects.
