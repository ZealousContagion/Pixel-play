## Overview
Cyber Runner is an experimental 3D endless runner built to push the boundaries of browser-based gaming. It features procedurally generated cityscapes and deterministic physics rendering.

## The Goal
The objective was to create a "console-quality" experience in a standard web browser, maintaining high visual fidelity while ensuring the game remains accessible on mid-range mobile devices.

## Key Challenges
- **Infinite Generation:** Creating a seamless, infinite world without causing memory leaks or "garbage collection" stutters.
- **Physics Accuracy:** Ensuring the runner's collision detection remains precise even at high velocities.
- **Visuals:** Implementing neon-glow effects (Bloom) without destroying the frame rate on mobile.

## Process Highlights
- **Procedural Geometry:** I developed a "chunk-based" loading system. As the player moves forward, buildings are generated ahead and pooled for reuse, minimizing instantiation overhead.
- **Custom Shaders:** Instead of using standard materials, I wrote custom GLSL shaders for the neon buildings, allowing for high-performance animation within a single draw call.
- **Deterministic Physics:** Integrated Rapier.js to ensure the game mechanics feel identical across different browser engines.

## Final Outcomes
- **Performance:** Maintained a stable 60FPS on iPhone 12+ and mid-range Android devices.
- **Engagement:** The project was featured on several creative tech galleries, garnering over 10k unique visitors in its first week.
- **Open Source:** The core procedural generation logic was released as a separate utility library for the R3F community.
