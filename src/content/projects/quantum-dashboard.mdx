## Overview
Quantum Analytics is a high-frequency trading dashboard designed for institutional traders who require sub-millisecond data visualization. The challenge was to render thousands of data points in real-time without compromising UI responsiveness.

## The Problem
Existing solutions struggled with "DOM bloat" when handling high-velocity WebSocket streams. Traders reported a 2-second lag during peak market volatility, which is unacceptable in high-stakes trading environments.

## My Role & Contributions
As the Lead Frontend Engineer, I architected the real-time data pipeline and designed the custom rendering engine. My responsibilities included:
- Implementing a **WebWorker-based data parser** to offload heavy JSON processing from the main thread.
- Designing a **Canvas-based charting library** that supports 60FPS rendering of 100k+ points.
- Developing a custom **Zustand middleware** for high-frequency state updates.

## Engineering Process
1.  **Benchmarking:** I started by stress-testing standard SVG-based charts, which failed at 1,000 updates/second.
2.  **Prototyping:** Switched to a hybrid approach—React for the UI shell and a raw Canvas API for the data-heavy layers.
3.  **Optimization:** Implemented "Update Batching," where WebSocket messages are collected over 16ms and rendered in a single animation frame.

## Outcomes & Impact
- **Zero Lag:** Achieved a consistent 60FPS even during 5,000+ data updates per second.
- **Improved Decision Speed:** User testing showed a 15% improvement in trader reaction times due to the improved visual clarity and zero-latency feedback.
- **Scalability:** The system now handles 5x the data volume of its predecessor with lower CPU overhead.
