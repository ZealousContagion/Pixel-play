## Overview
Chronos is a high-fidelity 3D product configurator designed for a luxury smartwatch brand. The goal was to bring the "in-store feel" to the browser.

## The Challenge
Traditional e-commerce photography fails to convey the premium materiality of luxury timepieces. The client needed a solution that allowed users to inspect the product from every angle without the performance cost of heavy video files or the "uncanny valley" effect of poor 3D renders.

## Engineering Highlights
- **PBR Materials:** Implemented custom Physically Based Rendering materials to accurately simulate brushed titanium and polished ceramic.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** A real-time HDR environment switcher that allows users to see the product in "Studio," "Daylight," and "Night" settings.
- **Instant Response:** Optimized geometry to ensure the 3D model loads in under 2 seconds on mobile devices.

## Impact
Increased customer engagement time on the product page by 300% during the initial pilot phase.
