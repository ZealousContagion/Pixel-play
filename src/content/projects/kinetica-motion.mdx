## Overview
Kinetica is a motion design system where every UI interaction is governed by real-world physics. It moves away from standard easing curves toward spring-based, interruptible animations.

## Technical Strategy
- **Inertial Scrolling:** Developed a custom scroll container that maintains momentum based on user velocity.
- **Spring-Based Haptics:** Every button click triggers a localized "shockwave" effect that feels tactile.
- **State Interpolation:** Using multi-variant interpolation to ensure transitions remain fluid even when interrupted by user input.

## Professional Result
The Kinetica system has been adopted as the core motion guidelines for three separate enterprise SaaS products.
