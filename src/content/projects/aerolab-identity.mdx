## Overview
AeroLab is a pioneer in Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) technology. I was tasked with creating a brand identity that conveys both safety and cutting-edge innovation.

## The Challenge
The aerospace industry is often seen as cold or overly traditional. AeroLab needed a visual language that felt futuristic yet approachable to potential investors and regulatory bodies.

## Design Strategy
- **Visual Metaphor:** The logo represents upward thrust and aerodynamic stability, utilizing a "Safety Orange" to highlight critical information against a "Deep Space Blue" background.
- **3D Brand Assets:** Developed a set of 3D icons and environment renders to be used across the digital presence, ensuring a consistent sense of depth and realism.
- **Custom Typography:** Modified a classic grotesque font to include subtle "aerodynamic" curves on terminals.

## My Contributions
- Led the complete visual identity design from concept to final brand guidelines.
- Created all 3D assets and animations for the website launch.
- Designed the UI for the pilot's mission control dashboard.

## Outcome
The new identity successfully launched AeroLab's Series B funding round, which was oversubscribed by 20%. The brand is now recognized as a leading voice in the urban air mobility sector.
